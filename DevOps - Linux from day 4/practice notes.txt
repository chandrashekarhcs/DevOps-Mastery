🐧 Linux Practice – Quick Revision Notes

---

1️⃣ Directory & File Permissions

 Check directory permission

```
ls -ld /home/ec2-user
```

Example output:

```
drwx------
```

Meaning:

```
d  → directory
rwx → owner
--- → group
--- → others
```

Numeric form:

```
700
```

✔ Only owner can access
❌ Others cannot enter directory

---

2️⃣ Why “Permission Denied” Happened

Even though file had:

```
-rw-r--r--
```

You still got:

```
Permission denied
```

Reason:

Parent directory had:

```
drwx------
```

Linux Rule:
To access a file:

Directory must have execute (x) permission
File must have read (r) permission

If directory blocks → file cannot be accessed.

3️⃣ Switching Users

Wrong:

```
su -user201 ❌
```

Correct:

```
su - user201 ✅
```

`-` loads full login environment.

 4️⃣ Using grep with ls

I practiced:

```
ls -l | grep demo
```

Meaning:

`|` → pipe
`grep` → filter output
Used for searching files or logs

Very important for DevOps log debugging.

5️⃣ Package Management (yum)

Search package

```
yum search tree
```

Install package

```
yum install tree ❌ (needs root)
sudo yum install tree ✅
```

Remove package

```
sudo yum remove tree
```

I practiced:

* Searching
* Installing
* Removing software

---

 6️⃣ Understanding sudo

* Normal user cannot install software
* sudo = temporary root access
* Required for system-level changes

---

 7️⃣ Home Directory Protection

Default home directory:

```
drwx------
```

Meaning:

Users cannot access other users' home directories
Security feature in Linux
