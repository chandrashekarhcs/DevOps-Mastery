DAY 5 NOTES, Devops - linux Links, System Resources, and User Administration

---

1. LINK FILES IN LINUX

---

A link file is a reference to another file in the Linux file system.
It works like a shortcut that points to the original file.

There are two types of links in Linux:

1. Soft Link (Symbolic Link)
2. Hard Link

---

2. SOFT LINK (SYMBOLIC LINK)

---

A soft link is similar to a Windows shortcut.
It points to the original file path.

Syntax:

ln -s <original_file_or_directory> <link_name>

Example:

ln -s samplefile softlinkfile

Key Points:

* It is just a pointer to the original file.
* If the original file is deleted, the soft link becomes broken.
* Soft links can be created for both files and directories.
* The inode numbers of the original file and soft link are different.
* Editing the original file updates the soft link automatically.

---

3. HARD LINK

---

A hard link is another reference to the same file data.
It directly points to the same inode.

Syntax:

ln <original_file_name> <hard_link_name>

Example:

ln samplefile hardlinkfile

Key Points:

* If the original file is deleted, the hard link still works.
* Hard links can only be created for files, not directories.
* The inode number of original and hard link files is the same.
* Editing one file updates the other automatically.
* File size remains the same for both.

---

4. INODE NUMBER

---

Every file and directory in Linux has a unique inode number.

It stores metadata such as:

Permissions
Owner
File size
Disk location

To check inode number:

ls -li <file_or_directory_name>

The first column shows the inode number.

---

5. AUTOCOMPLETION

---

Use the Tab key for autocompletion.

Type the first few characters of a file or directory name, then press Tab.

Example:

cat c + Tab

If census_data exists, it will auto-complete.

---

6. COMPUTE RESOURCES

---

Compute resources mean hardware resources such as:

RAM
HDD (Storage)
CPU

In AWS EC2 Free Tier:

RAM: 1 GB
Storage: 8 GB
CPU: 1 Core

---

7. CHECK CURRENT USER

---

Command:

whoami

Displays the username currently logged in.

---

8. CHECK SYSTEM MEMORY (RAM)

---

Command:

free -m

Displays memory usage in MB.

---

9. CHECK DISK SPACE

---

Command:

df -kh .

Displays disk usage in human-readable format.

---

10. CHECK NUMBER OF CPUs

---

Command:

nproc

Displays number of CPU cores available.

---

11. USER ADMINISTRATION OVERVIEW

---

There are two types of users in Linux:

1. Root User
2. Normal User

---

12. ROOT USER

---

Root is the administrator of the system.

Details:

Username: root
User ID (UID): 0
Home Directory: /root

Root user can:

Install or uninstall software
Add or delete users
Modify system configurations
Change file permissions
Restart or shut down the server
Access all files

---

13. NORMAL USERS

---

Normal users:

Can create, edit, or delete files only in their home directory.
Example: /home/ec2-user

Cannot:

Install system software
Modify system files
Create new users
Change system configurations

---

14. SWITCH TO ROOT USER

---

Command:

sudo su -

---

15. CREATE A NEW USER

---

Switch to root first.

Command:

useradd <username>

Example:

useradd viratkohli

---

16. VERIFY USER CREATION

---

Method 1:

cd /home
ls -lrt

Method 2:

cat /etc/passwd | tail -1

---

17. NOTES ON USER CREATION

---

When a new user is created:

A new group with the same name is automatically created.
A home directory is automatically created under /home.

---

18. SWITCH BETWEEN USERS

---

Command:

su - <username>

Example:

su - viratkohli

---

19. SET PASSWORD FOR USER

---

Command:

passwd <username>

Example:

passwd viratkohli

Password will not be visible while typing.

---

20. SUDO USERS

---

Sudo stands for super user do.

Users with sudo permissions can execute commands as root without logging in as root.

For security reasons, not all users should have root access.

---

21. ADD USER TO SUDO GROUP

---

Step 1: Login as root

sudo su -

Step 2: Edit sudoers file

vi /etc/sudoers

Add:

<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Example:

devops_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Save using:

:wq!

If file is read-only:

chmod 640 /etc/sudoers

Step 3: Restart SSH service

service sshd restart

Verify using:

sudo <command>

---

22. DELETE A USER

---

Command:

userdel <username>

---

23. CREATE A GROUP MANUALLY

---

Command:

groupadd <groupname>

---

24. ASSIGNMENT

---

1. Command to check size of a file
   Use: ls -lh or du -h <filename>

2. Create multiple users
   Add them to sudo group
   Verify sudo privileges
