# DevOps Learning Resources

Welcome! This repository is a **curated collection of DevOps learning resources** that I’m using to build strong, practical skills across the DevOps lifecycle from development and CI/CD to infrastructure, cloud, and reliability.

The goal of this repo is simple:

* Centralize high‑quality learning material
* Track my DevOps learning journey
* Focus on hands‑on, real‑world tools and practices
