Linux Fundamentals

1. Absolute Path vs Relative Path

Absolute Path

* Absolute path is the **complete path to a file or directory**.
* It always starts from the **root directory `/`**.
* Every file and directory in Linux originates from `/`.

Example:

```
/home/ec2-user/d1/d2/d3/census_data_linkfile
```

This path is valid from anywhere in the system.

---

Relative Path

* Relative path is the path **relative to your current working directory (pwd)**.
* It does NOT start with `/`.

Example:

If current directory is:

```
/home/ec2-user
```

Then relative path:

```
d1/d2/d3/census_data_linkfile
```

---

Key Difference

| Absolute Path       | Relative Path               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Starts with `/`     | Does NOT start with `/`     |
| Full path from root | Path from current directory |
| Works from anywhere | Depends on current location |

---

2. Manual Pages and Help Commands

man command (Manual Pages)

Used to view detailed documentation of a command.

Syntax:

```
man <command>
```

Example:

```
man ls
```

This shows:

* Description
* Options
* Usage

---

"--help option"

Shows quick help and options for a command.

**Syntax:**

```
<command> --help
```

**Example:**

```
ls --help
```

---

3. Linux File Permissions

Linux permissions are divided into **3 levels**:

1. User (Owner)
2. Group
3. Others

Total permissions = **9**

Example:

```
-rwx rw- r-x
```

Breakdown:

```
User   Group   Others
rwx    rw-     r-x
```

---

Meaning of Permissions

| Symbol | Meaning | Value | Usage                 |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| r      | Read    | 4     | View file contents    |
| w      | Write   | 2     | Modify or delete file |
| x      | Execute | 1     | Run file as program   |

---

Permission Calculation

Add values:

Example:

```
rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
rw- = 4+2+0 = 6
r-- = 4+0+0 = 4
```

Example permission:

```
-rw-r--r--
 644
```

Means:

* User: read, write
* Group: read
* Others: read

---

4. chmod (Change Mode)

Used to change file or directory permissions.

---

Syntax (File)

```
chmod <permission_number> <filename>
```

Example:

```
chmod 777 file.txt
```

Gives full permissions to everyone.

---

Syntax (Directory)

```
chmod -R <permission_number> <directory>
```

`-R` means recursive (applies to all subdirectories and files)

Example:

```
chmod -R 755 mydir
```

---

Common Permission Settings

| Permission | Number | Meaning                            |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| -rw------- | 600    | Only user can read and write       |
| -rw-r--r-- | 644    | User can read/write, others read   |
| -rwx------ | 700    | Only user has full access          |
| -rwxr-xr-x | 755    | User full, others read and execute |
| -rw-rw-rw- | 666    | Everyone read/write (unsafe)       |
| -rwxrwxrwx | 777    | Everyone full access (very unsafe) |

---

5. chown (Change Ownership)

Used to change file or directory owner.

---

## Syntax (File)

```
chown username:groupname filename
```

Example:

```
chown devops:devops file.txt
```

---

Syntax (Directory)

```
chown -R username:groupname directory
```

`-R` is required for directories.

Example:

```
chown -R devops:devops mydir
```

---

6. Software Management in Linux

Software in Linux is called **packages**.

Examples:

| OS                   | Package Manager |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| RedHat, Amazon Linux | yum             |
| Ubuntu, Debian       | apt             |
| Windows              | Microsoft Store |
| Android              | Play Store      |

---

7. yum Package Manager (RedHat / Amazon Linux)

Used to:

* Search packages
* Install packages
* Remove packages
* Update system

---

## Search Package

```
yum search <package_name>
```

Example:

```
yum search git
yum search tree
```

---

## Install Package

```
yum install <package_name>
```

Example:

```
yum install git
```

Linux will ask:

```
Is this ok [y/d/N]:
```

Press:

```
y
```

---

## Remove Package

```
yum remove <package_name>
```

Example:

```
yum remove git
```

---

# 8. Linux System Updates

Updating system improves:

* Security
* Stability
* Features

Linux updates are manual.

---

## Update Command

Updates package list.

```
sudo yum update
```

This checks for available updates.

---

## Upgrade Command

Actually installs updates.

```
sudo yum upgrade
```

This may take time depending on number of packages.

---
